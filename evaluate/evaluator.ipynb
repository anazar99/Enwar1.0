    "\n",
    "Impact of Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles\n",
    "1. Signal Blockage:\n",
    "   - Ambulance Proximity: The ambulance being as close as 3-5 meters significantly blocks the line of sight (LoS) for wireless signals. This obstruction can result in signal shadowing, where the signal cannot pass directly through the large metal body of the vehicle, leading to areas of weak or no signal immediately behind it.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Signal Reflection and Multipath Interference:\n",
    "   - Metal Surfaces: The metal surfaces of the nearby ambulance and other vehicles can reflect signals, causing multipath interference. This occurs when the signal bounces off these surfaces and arrives at the receiver at slightly different times, potentially causing distortion and reducing signal clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic Obstacle:\n",
    "   - Movement of Vehicles: The movement of the ambulance and other nearby vehicles means that the nature of the obstacle is dynamic. As these vehicles move relative to Unit 1, the degree and nature of the signal obstruction and reflection change, causing fluctuating signal quality.\n",

    "The physical environment includes a well-lit highway with multiple vehicles, including a very close ambulance that serves as a significant obstacle. The proximity of the ambulance and other vehicles creates substantial blockage and reflection of signals, leading to potential issues like signal shadowing and multipath interference.

    "\n",
    "1. General Setting:\n",
    "   - The images capture a busy urban intersection underneath an overpass. The setting includes multiple lanes of traffic, vehicles, and traffic signals.\n",
    "   - The scene is well-lit, with clear weather and sunlight visible in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Vehicles and Obstacles:\n",
    "   - Proximity to Transmitter: The transmitter (Unit 2) is 10.54 meters away from the receiver (Unit 1) at a bearing of 159.90 degrees.\n",
    "   - Detected Vehicles:\n",
    "     - A vehicle detected 21.48 meters away at 314.58 degrees.\n",
    "     - A vehicle detected 24.33 meters away at 336.26 degrees.\n",
    "     - A vehicle detected 11.60 meters away at 168.20 degrees.\n",
    "     - A vehicle detected 15.38 meters away at 188.91 degrees.\n",
    "     - A vehicle detected 23.36 meters away at 163.50 degrees.\n",
    "   - The vehicles detected by LiDAR are within close range, with the closest vehicle being just over 11 meters away. These vehicles are potential obstacles and must be navigated carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Image Analysis:\n",
    "   - First Image:\n",
    "     - The image shows a view from under an overpass. There are multiple cars visible, some parked on the side and others moving through the intersection.\n",
    "     - The presence of a directional sign (curved arrow) suggests lane changes or merges, which could be potential points of congestion or conflict.\n",
    "     - The underpass creates areas of shadow, which might obscure visibility and create additional hazards.\n",
    "   - Second Image:\n",
    "     - This image provides a broader view of the intersection. Multiple vehicles, including a white SUV and various sedans, are navigating the intersection.\n",
    "     - The traffic flow is regulated by traffic lights, which are visible in the distance.\n",
    "     - The mixture of moving and stationary vehicles, along with the traffic signals, indicates a complex traffic environment requiring careful navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Obstacles and Challenges:\n",
    "   - Parked Vehicles: Cars parked along the sides of the road under the overpass can limit maneuvering space and create potential blind spots.\n",
    "   - Moving Traffic: Vehicles moving in different directions, especially near the intersection, increase the likelihood of potential conflicts.\n",
    "   - Lighting Conditions: The shadow cast by the overpass can create low-visibility areas, posing a challenge for both human drivers and autonomous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Additional Details:\n",
    "   - The environment includes typical urban features like traffic lights, road signs, and diverse vehicle types.\n",
    "   - The road appears to be well-maintained, but the presence of an overpass suggests a multi-layered traffic system with potential complexity in navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the physical environment depicted involves navigating a busy urban intersection with a mixture of parked and moving vehicles, variable lighting conditions due to the overpass, and multiple potential obstacles identified by the LiDAR system. These factors collectively create a challenging environment for both human and autonomous navigation.\n",

    "ground_truth_sample =[\"\"\"Based on the information provided from Unit 1's sensors (GPS, LiDAR, and cameras), here’s a detailed description of the physical environment between Unit 1 and Unit 2, as well as the broader surroundings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Location and Relative Positioning**\n",
    "   - Unit 2 (Vehicle with GPS and transmitter) is located 7.75 meters away from Unit 1, almost directly north, at a bearing of 358.82 degrees. This suggests that Unit 2 is quite close and positioned slightly to the right of the true north direction.\n",
    "   - The space between Unit 1 and Unit 2 is relatively clear, with no major obstacles directly blocking the path.\n",
    "   -  No specific obstacles like pedestrians, bicycles, or stationary objects were mentioned within the immediate vicinity are affecting the interaction between Unit 1 and Unit 2 and ensures direct line-of-sight communication between the two vehicles.\n",
    "   - Between Unit 1 and Unit 2, however, it seems relatively clear since Unit 2 is only about 7.75 meters away, indicating minimal obstructions along this line-of-sight path\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LiDAR Object Detection** \n",
    "LiDAR detects multiple objects, primarily vehicles, around Unit 1, providing insight into the surrounding traffic and congestion:\n",
    "   - Vehicle 1: Detected 16.77 meters away at a bearing of 350.83 degrees, slightly north-northwest of Unit 1. This vehicle might be moving in traffic or parked on the side of the road but is distant enough not to block the immediate path.\n",
    "   - Vehicle 2: Detected 16.08 meters away at a bearing of 335.32 degrees, positioned northwest of Unit 1. This vehicle, too, is somewhat far, possibly contributing to the congestion.\n",
    "   - Vehicle 3: Detected 13.74 meters away at a bearing of 280.51 degrees, which places it west of Unit 1. This suggests that this vehicle could be parked or moving on the other side of the road or in a nearby lane.\n",
    "   - Vehicle 4: Detected 16.64 meters away at a bearing of 195.72 degrees, south-southwest of Unit 1. It’s distant enough not to be an immediate concern for obstruction.\n",
    "   - Vehicle 5: Detected 8.07 meters away at a bearing of 182.27 degrees, almost directly south of Unit 1. This vehicle is relatively close, which may indicate another car in close proximity to Unit 1, possibly contributing to the traffic.\n",
    "   - Vehicle 6: Detected 15.04 meters away at a bearing of 161.45 degrees, southeast of Unit 1. Like other detected vehicles, this could be part of the ongoing congestion or parked.\n",
    "   - Pedestrian: Detected 17.08 meters away at a bearing of 35.32 degrees, located northeast of Unit 1. This person is farther away but could be moving on the sidewalk or crossing the street.\n",
    "   - Cyclist: Detected 16.64 meters away at a bearing of 55.72 degrees, located east-northeast of Unit 1. The cyclist may be moving parallel to traffic or on the side of the road, relatively far from Unit 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Camera Description of the Scene**\n",
    "The camera provides a visual context, showing a busy city street filled with vehicles, including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and trees and palm trees lining the street. The scene is one of moderate to heavy traffic, with several vehicles parked along the side of the road while others move forward, contributing to a congested traffic situation. The bright sunlight suggests that visibility is good, but the sun may cause some glare or shadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Obstacles and Potential Blockages**\n",
    "   - The detected vehicles and pedestrians form a somewhat congested environment, though none of the vehicles are directly between Unit 1 and Unit 2 based on their relative bearings.\n",
    "   - However, with multiple vehicles surrounding Unit 1, especially one 8.07 meters away to the south (Vehicle 5), this vehicle is close enough to potentially obstruct the path depending on traffic conditions.\n",
    "   - The pedestrian and cyclist, although not in the direct path between Unit 1 and Unit 2, suggest additional dynamic elements in the scene. The pedestrian is more distant, but the cyclist, being closer, may need to be watched for movement, as cyclists are typically faster than pedestrians and could be harder to track as they move through traffic.\n",
    "   - Parked cars along the side of the street are contributing to the congestion but don’t directly block the immediate space between Unit 1 and Unit 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Estimated Distances and Spatial Relationships**\n",
    "   - From the detected bearings and distances, the environment around Unit 1 can be described as moderately busy, with vehicles scattered mostly between 8 and 17 meters away, indicating nearby traffic but no immediate blockages.\n",
    "   - The closest objects detected are Unit 2 (7.75 meters away) and Vehicle 5 (8.07 meters away). However, Unit 2 is almost directly north, while Vehicle 5 is to the south, so they do not interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Unit 1 is navigating a congested urban environment with multiple vehicles and a cyclist nearby, but the path to Unit 2 is relatively clear, as no major obstacles directly block it. Unit 1 is surrounded by moving and parked vehicles, suggesting a slow-moving traffic flow, but none of the detected vehicles or objects create an immediate obstruction between the two units. The scene includes pedestrians, cyclists, and various vehicles, contributing to a dynamic environment that may require careful navigation and monitoring, especially as traffic and other elements move in the scene.\"\"\",\"\"] \n"
