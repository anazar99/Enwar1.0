Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The receiver (Unit 1) is 34.453423627567986 meters away at a bearing of 3.610133544479254 degrees from the transmitter (Unit 2). LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 19.44 meters away at a direction of 295.38 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene depicts a view from the front seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked on the side of the road, and the driver appears to be standing next to it. There are several buildings visible in the background, including a tall building on the right side of the image. Additionally, there is a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk near the car. The sun is shining brightly in the sky, casting a warm and inviting glow over the scene.The scene depicts a view from the back seat of a car driving down a city street. There are several buildings visible in the background, including a tall building on the left side of the image and a shorter building on the right side. In the foreground, there is a bottle of water placed on the dashboard of the car. Additionally, there are two people standing on the sidewalk, one on the left side and one on the right side of the street.
Physical Environment Description

Scene Overview
- Location: The environment is an urban city street, characterized by multiple buildings, vehicles, and pedestrians.
- Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.

Objects and Distances
1. Vehicles:
   - White Car: Positioned in the middle of the street in the first image. Estimated distance: approximately 8-10 meters from Unit 1.
   - Blue Car: Visible farther down the street in the second image. Estimated distance: approximately 30-35 meters from Unit 1.

2. Pedestrians:
   - First Image: One person standing on the sidewalk near the car. Estimated distance: approximately 5-7 meters from Unit 1.
   - Second Image: Three people waiting at a bus stop on the left side of the street. Estimated distance: approximately 15-20 meters from Unit 1.

3. Buildings:
   - Left Side: Several buildings, including a tall one with a modern design and a Taco Bell outlet.
   - Right Side: Multiple buildings, including a tall building and several lower structures.

4. Traffic Lights and Signs:
   - Traffic lights are visible at the intersection ahead, approximately 50-60 meters away.
   - Street signs provide additional context for the urban environment.

LiDAR Object Detection Results
- Vehicle Detection:
  - 19.44 meters away at 295.38 degrees: Likely a vehicle positioned in the upper left quadrant relative to Unit 1.

GPS Module Information
- Transmitter (Unit 2):
  - Distance: 34.45 meters away.
  - Bearing: 3.61 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly north).

Potential Obstacles
1. Vehicles:
   - Multiple vehicles at varying distances can create potential obstacles, causing blockage or reflection of signals.

2. Pedestrians:
   - Pedestrians can cause temporary signal blockage or reflection, adding dynamic elements to the environment.

3. Buildings and Structures:
   - Buildings on either side of the street can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals, especially those in higher frequency ranges.

Environmental Factors
- Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
- Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.

Summary of Scene
The physical environment includes a well-lit urban city street with multiple buildings, vehicles, and pedestrians. The parked and moving vehicles, as well as the pedestrians, serve as potential obstacles, impacting the line of sight for wireless communication between Unit 1 and Unit 2. The buildings on either side of the street can introduce additional interference and attenuation effects. Overall, the clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with vehicles and pedestrians can cause fluctuations in signal quality.
