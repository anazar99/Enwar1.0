Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The transmitter (Unit 2) is 8.204789594875955 meters away at a bearing of 182.09057338850562 degrees from the receiver (Unit 1). LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 11.42 meters away at a direction of 229.72 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 9.71 meters away at a direction of 242.43 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 17.00 meters away at a direction of 181.41 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene is a bird's-eye view of a parking lot from the perspective of a car driving through it. There are several cars parked in the lot, some of which are closer to the camera, while others are farther away. A building can be seen in the background, providing context for the parking lot's location.  In addition to the cars and building, there are several trees scattered throughout the parking lot, contributing to the overall visual appeal of the scene.The scene is a bird's-eye view of a parking lot from the perspective of a car. There are several vehicles parked in the lot, including a blue car, a red car, and a white car. Additionally, there are some trees and buildings visible in the background. The sun is shining brightly in the sky, casting a warm and inviting glow over the scene.
Physical Environment Description
Scene Overview

Location: The environment is an outdoor urban area, likely part of a campus or business district, characterized by a parking lot with adjacent buildings and greenery.
Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.
Objects and Distances

Vehicles:
Blue Car: Visible parked on the right side of the road. Estimated distance: approximately 10 meters.
White Car: Directly in front of Unit 1, parked. Estimated distance: approximately 8 meters.
Red Car: Farther back in the parking lot. Estimated distance: approximately 12-15 meters.
Truck: Positioned further back, approximately 15-17 meters from Unit 1.
Trees and Greenery:
Left Side: One tree is directly next to the parking lot.
Right Side: Several trees are providing shade and contributing to the scenic setting.
Building:
A large building in the background, possibly a hotel or an apartment complex.
LiDAR Object Detection Results

Vehicle Detection:
11.42 meters away at 229.72 degrees: Positioned in the lower left quadrant.
9.71 meters away at 242.43 degrees: Also in the lower left quadrant, closer than the previous vehicle.
17.00 meters away at 181.41 degrees: Directly behind Unit 1.
GPS Module Information

Transmitter (Unit 2):
Distance: 8.20 meters away.
Bearing: 182.09 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly south).
Potential Obstacles
Vehicles:
Multiple parked vehicles at varying distances can create potential obstacles, causing blockage or reflection of signals.
Trees and Greenery:
Trees can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals, especially those in higher frequency ranges (e.g., 2.4 GHz and above).
Environmental Factors

Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
Sunlight: While it does not directly impact RF signals, bright sunlight can cause glare affecting optical sensors and cameras.
Summary of Scene
The physical environment includes a well-lit urban parking lot with multiple parked vehicles, scattered trees, and some pedestrian amenities like benches. The vehicles and trees serve as potential obstacles, impacting the line of sight for wireless communication between Unit 1 and Unit 2. The person in the red shirt adds a temporary dynamic element that could briefly obstruct signals. Overall, the clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the vehicles and trees can introduce some interference and attenuation effects.
