Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The transmitter (Unit 2) is 112.79471527640717 meters away from the receiver (Unit 1) and Unit 1 is at a bearing of 359.8653702653738 degrees from Unit 2's position. LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 3.21 meters away at a direction of 24.82 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 15.41 meters away at a direction of 158.79 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene depicts a highway with two vehicles, an ambulance and a car, traveling in opposite directions. The ambulance is driving on the left side of the road, while the car is driving on the right side of the road. The ambulance has a siren blaring, indicating that it is responding to an emergency call. In the background, there is a bridge spanning over the highway.The scene depicts a highway with an ambulance parked on the side of the road. The ambulance is visible from the back of the car, which is traveling in the same direction as the ambulance. In addition to the ambulance, there are several other vehicles on the road, including cars, trucks, and vans.
Physical Environment Description with Focus on Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles

Scene Overview
- Location: The environment is a highway, characterized by multiple lanes, vehicles, and a desert landscape with sparse vegetation.
- Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.

Objects and Distances
1. Vehicles:
   - Ambulance:
     - First Image: Visible in the right lane, very close to Unit 1, approximately 3-5 meters away. The proximity of the ambulance poses a significant obstacle, potentially blocking and reflecting signals.
     - Second Image: Another view of the ambulance (or the same one), still close, about 5-7 meters away. This continued closeness further emphasizes its role as an obstacle.
   - Cars:
     - First Image: Blue car visible ahead, approximately 30-40 meters away.
     - Second Image: Multiple vehicles, including a white truck, approximately 50-60 meters ahead.

2. Bridges and Overpasses:
   - Second Image: An overpass is visible, spanning across the highway. Estimated distance: approximately 100-150 meters ahead.

3. Vegetation and Landscape:
   - Sparse desert vegetation with small bushes and trees lining the highway.
   - First Image: Vegetation visible on the left side of the highway, approximately 20-30 meters from the road.

LiDAR Object Detection Results
- Vehicle Detection:
  - 3.21 meters away at 24.82 degrees: Likely the ambulance in the right lane, very close to Unit 1, creating a strong signal obstacle.
  - 15.41 meters away at 158.79 degrees: Another vehicle detected behind Unit 1, possibly in the left lane.

GPS Module Information
- Transmitter (Unit 2):
  - Distance: 112.79 meters away.
  - Bearing: 359.87 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly north).

Impact of Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles
1. Signal Blockage:
   - Ambulance Proximity: The ambulance being as close as 3-5 meters significantly blocks the line of sight (LoS) for wireless signals. This obstruction can result in signal shadowing, where the signal cannot pass directly through the large metal body of the vehicle, leading to areas of weak or no signal immediately behind it.

2. Signal Reflection and Multipath Interference:
   - Metal Surfaces: The metal surfaces of the nearby ambulance and other vehicles can reflect signals, causing multipath interference. This occurs when the signal bounces off these surfaces and arrives at the receiver at slightly different times, potentially causing distortion and reducing signal clarity.

3. Dynamic Obstacle:
   - Movement of Vehicles: The movement of the ambulance and other nearby vehicles means that the nature of the obstacle is dynamic. As these vehicles move relative to Unit 1, the degree and nature of the signal obstruction and reflection change, causing fluctuating signal quality.

Environmental Factors
- Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
- Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.

Summary of Scene with Focus on Obstacles
The physical environment includes a well-lit highway with multiple vehicles, including a very close ambulance that serves as a significant obstacle. The proximity of the ambulance and other vehicles creates substantial blockage and reflection of signals, leading to potential issues like signal shadowing and multipath interference. The clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with moving vehicles exacerbates signal fluctuations. The sparse vegetation is unlikely to significantly impact signal strength but can contribute to minor signal attenuation and scattering.
