Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The transmitter (Unit 2) is 30.78343479907267 meters away at a bearing of 3.655295658299565 degrees from the receiver (Unit 1). LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 8.18 meters away at a direction of 11.21 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 9.27 meters away at a direction of 189.68 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 8.45 meters away at a direction of 163.50 degrees. . Scene details from camera: The scene depicts a busy highway with multiple cars driving on it. There are at least three cars visible in the image, including a white car, a blue car, and a black car. Additionally, there is a truck parked on the side of the road, which adds to the diversity of vehicles on the highway. Traffic lights can be seen in the distance, indicating the presence of intersections along the road. The view from the cars front windshield provides a birds-eye perspective of the busy highway and its surroundings.The scene is captured from a back POV of a car traveling down a busy highway. There are multiple vehicles on the road, including cars, trucks, and buses, creating a congested traffic flow. The sun is shining brightly in the sky, casting a warm and inviting glow over the scene. In addition to the vehicles, there are several buildings visible in the background, providing context for the location.
Physical Environment Description with Focus on Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles

Scene Overview
- Location: The environment is a busy highway, characterized by multiple lanes, vehicles, and urban elements such as buildings and signage.
- Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.

Objects and Distances
1. Vehicles:
   - First Image:
     - Red Minivan: Visible in the center lane, approximately 8-10 meters from Unit 1. The proximity of this vehicle makes it a significant obstacle.
     - White Car: In the right lane, approximately 12-15 meters ahead.
     - Blue Car: Slightly further ahead in the center lane, approximately 20-25 meters from Unit 1.
     - Other Vehicles: Various vehicles seen ahead at distances ranging from 30 to 100 meters.
   - Second Image:
     - White Car: Visible on the left lane, approximately 8-10 meters from Unit 1.
     - Silver Car: In the center lane, approximately 20-25 meters ahead.
     - Other Vehicles: Various vehicles, including trucks, at distances ranging from 20 to 100 meters.

2. Buildings and Signage:
   - U-Haul Technical Center: Visible on the right side of the highway, approximately 50-100 meters away.
   - Other Buildings: Industrial and commercial buildings are visible along the highway.

3. Vegetation:
   - Sparse desert vegetation visible along the sides of the highway, approximately 10-20 meters from the road.

LiDAR Object Detection Results
- Vehicle Detection:
  - 8.18 meters away at 11.21 degrees: Likely the red minivan in the center lane.
  - 9.27 meters away at 189.68 degrees: Vehicle detected behind Unit 1.
  - 8.45 meters away at 163.50 degrees: White car in the left lane.

GPS Module Information
- Transmitter (Unit 2):
  - Distance: 30.78 meters away.
  - Bearing: 3.66 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly north).

Impact of Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles
1. Signal Blockage:
   - Close Proximity of Vehicles: The red minivan approximately 8-10 meters away and the white car 8-10 meters away pose significant obstacles. Their proximity can block the line of sight (LoS) for wireless signals, causing shadowing where signals cannot pass through the metal bodies of the vehicles, resulting in areas of weak or no signal immediately behind them.

2. Signal Reflection and Multipath Interference:
   - Metal Surfaces: The metal surfaces of the nearby cars reflect signals, causing multipath interference. This occurs when the signal bounces off these surfaces and arrives at the receiver at slightly different times, potentially causing distortion and reducing signal clarity.

3. Dynamic Obstacles:
   - Movement of Vehicles: The movement of the cars and other vehicles means that the nature of the obstacle is dynamic. As these vehicles move relative to Unit 1, the degree and nature of the signal obstruction and reflection change, causing fluctuating signal quality.

Environmental Factors
- Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
- Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.

Summary of Scene with Focus on Obstacles
The physical environment includes a well-lit highway with multiple vehicles, including very close cars that serve as significant obstacles. The proximity of the cars creates substantial blockage and reflection of signals, leading to potential issues like signal shadowing and multipath interference. The clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with moving vehicles exacerbates signal fluctuations. The buildings and signage, such as the U-Haul Technical Center, provide context for the location, while the sparse vegetation contributes to the overall scene without significantly impacting signal strength.
