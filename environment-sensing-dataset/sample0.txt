Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The transmitter (Unit 2) is 8.066753628120216 meters away at a bearing of 182.27478933305133 degrees from the receiver (Unit 1). LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 15.07 meters away at a direction of 322.89 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 11.38 meters away at a direction of 229.71 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 9.83 meters away at a direction of 241.23 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 16.96 meters away at a direction of 181.47 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene depicts a man wearing a red shirt standing in the middle of a city street near a parking lot. There are several cars parked in the parking lot, and some of them are visible in the background. The man appears to be gesturing with his hand, possibly indicating something to the driver of the car he is standing next to. In addition to the man and the parked cars, there are several trees scattered throughout the scene. One tree can be seen on the left side of the image, while another is located on the right side. There are also two benches present, one on the left side and another on the right side of the image. The scene is a bird's-eye view of a parking lot from the perspective of a car. There are several vehicles parked in the lot, including a blue car, a white car, and a truck. Additionally, there are some trees visible in the background, providing a scenic setting for the parking lot. The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm and inviting glow over the area.
Physical Environment Description
Scene Overview

Location: An outdoor urban area, likely part of a campus or business district, characterized by a parking lot with adjacent buildings and greenery.
Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.
Objects and Distances

Man in Red Shirt:
Position: Standing in the middle of the street near a parking lot.
Distance to Unit 1: Approximately 5 meters, based on the image perspective.
Action: Gesturing with his hand, possibly communicating with the driver of a nearby vehicle.
Vehicles:
Blue Car: Directly in front of Unit 1, parked. Estimated distance: approximately 8 meters.
White Car: Visible in the parking lot, partially obscured by trees. Estimated distance: around 10-12 meters.
Truck: Positioned further back, approximately 15-17 meters from Unit 1.
Trees and Greenery:
Left Side: One tree is directly next to the parking lot.
Right Side: Several trees are providing shade and contributing to the scenic setting.
Benches:
One bench on the left side and another on the right side, indicating a pedestrian-friendly area.
LiDAR Object Detection Results

Vehicle Detection:
15.07 meters away at 322.89 degrees: Likely in the upper right quadrant relative to Unit 1.
11.38 meters away at 229.71 degrees: Positioned in the lower left quadrant.
9.83 meters away at 241.23 degrees: Also in the lower left quadrant, closer than the previous vehicle.
16.96 meters away at 181.47 degrees: Directly behind Unit 1.
GPS Module Information

Transmitter (Unit 2):
Distance: 8.07 meters away.
Bearing: 182.27 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly south).
Potential Obstacles
Vehicles:
Multiple parked vehicles at varying distances can create potential obstacles, causing blockage or reflection of signals.
Trees and Greenery:
Trees can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals, especially those in higher frequency ranges (e.g., 2.4 GHz and above).
Pedestrian (Man in Red Shirt):
As a temporary obstacle, he may cause minor fluctuations in signal quality due to blockage or reflection.
Environmental Factors

Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
Sunlight: While it does not directly impact RF signals, bright sunlight can cause glare affecting optical sensors and cameras.
Summary of Scene
The physical environment includes a well-lit urban parking lot with multiple parked vehicles, scattered trees, and some pedestrian amenities like benches. The vehicles and trees serve as potential obstacles, impacting the line of sight for wireless communication between Unit 1 and Unit 2. The man in the red shirt adds a temporary dynamic element that could briefly obstruct signals. Overall, the clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the vehicles and trees can introduce some interference and attenuation effects.
