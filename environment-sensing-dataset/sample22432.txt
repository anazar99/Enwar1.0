Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The transmitter (Unit 2) is 30.478007928925432 meters away at a bearing of 5.203883054678897 degrees from the receiver (Unit 1).  LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 15.08 meters away at a direction of 20.64 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 9.64 meters away at a direction of 187.22 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 7.73 meters away at a direction of 158.20 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene is captured from the front view of a car traveling down a busy highway. There are multiple vehicles on the road, including cars, trucks, and buses, creating a congested traffic flow. The highway is lined with palm trees, adding a scenic touch to the urban environment. In the background, there is a blue sky visible, providing a clear and sunny day for the driver's journey. Overall, the image captures the hustle and bustle of a busy highway, showcasing the diversity of vehicles and the presence of palm trees along the roadside.The scene depicts a car driving down a freeway with a blue IKEA building visible in the background. The car is traveling at a moderate speed, and there are several other vehicles on the road as well. Some of these vehicles are closer to the camera, while others are farther away.  In addition to the cars, there are two trucks visible in the scene. One truck is parked on the side of the road, while the other is driving on the freeway. There are also several trees lining the sides of the road, adding to the scenic view.
Physical Environment Description with Focus on Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles

Scene Overview
- Location: The environment is a busy highway, characterized by multiple lanes, vehicles, and urban elements such as buildings and palm trees.
- Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.

Objects and Distances
1. Vehicles:
   - First Image:
     - White Car: Visible in the right lane, approximately 15-20 meters from Unit 1.
     - Other Vehicles: Various vehicles are seen ahead at distances ranging from 30 to 100 meters.
   - Second Image:
     - Red Car: Visible in the center lane, approximately 7-10 meters from Unit 1.
     - White Car: In the right lane, approximately 15 meters ahead.
     - Other Vehicles: Various vehicles, including trucks, at distances ranging from 20 to 100 meters.

2. Buildings:
   - IKEA Building: Large blue building visible on the right side of the highway, approximately 50-100 meters away.

3. Trees and Greenery:
   - Palm trees line the highway, adding a scenic element to the urban environment.
   - Sparse desert vegetation visible on the left side of the highway, approximately 20-30 meters from the road.

LiDAR Object Detection Results
- Vehicle Detection:
  - 15.08 meters away at 20.64 degrees: Likely the white car in the right lane.
  - 9.64 meters away at 187.22 degrees: Vehicle detected behind Unit 1.
  - 7.73 meters away at 158.20 degrees: Red car in the center lane.

GPS Module Information
- Transmitter (Unit 2):
  - Distance: 30.48 meters away.
  - Bearing: 5.20 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly north).

Impact of Nearby Vehicles as Obstacles
1. Signal Blockage:
   - Close Proximity of Vehicles: The white car approximately 15-20 meters away and the red car 7-10 meters away pose significant obstacles. Their proximity can block the line of sight (LoS) for wireless signals, causing shadowing where signals cannot pass through the metal bodies of the vehicles, resulting in areas of weak or no signal immediately behind them.

2. Signal Reflection and Multipath Interference:
   - Metal Surfaces: The metal surfaces of the nearby cars reflect signals, causing multipath interference. This occurs when the signal bounces off these surfaces and arrives at the receiver at slightly different times, potentially causing distortion and reducing signal clarity.

3. Dynamic Obstacles:
   - Movement of Vehicles: The movement of the cars and other vehicles means that the nature of the obstacle is dynamic. As these vehicles move relative to Unit 1, the degree and nature of the signal obstruction and reflection change, causing fluctuating signal quality.

Environmental Factors
- Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
- Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.

Summary of Scene with Focus on Obstacles
The physical environment includes a well-lit highway with multiple vehicles, including very close cars that serve as significant obstacles. The proximity of the cars creates substantial blockage and reflection of signals, leading to potential issues like signal shadowing and multipath interference. The clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with moving vehicles exacerbates signal fluctuations. The palm trees and sparse vegetation are unlikely to significantly impact signal strength but can contribute to minor signal attenuation and scattering. The large IKEA building is a notable landmark, providing context for the location.
