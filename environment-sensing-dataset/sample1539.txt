Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter.  The receiver (Unit 1) is 9.518030283574547 meters away at a bearing of 358.69660658751474 degrees from the transmitter (Unit 2). LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 14.37 meters away at a direction of 338.02 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 16.26 meters away at a direction of 181.69 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene depicts a city street with two cars parked on the side of the road. One of the cars is white, while the other is black. There is also a bus driving down the street, passing by the parked cars.  In addition to the cars and bus, there are several people visible in the scene. Two people can be seen walking on the sidewalk on the left side of the street, while another person is standing on the sidewalk on the right side of the street. Overall, the image captures a bustling urban environment with vehicles and pedestrians moving along the street.The scene depicts a view from the back of a car as it drives down a busy city street. There are multiple vehicles on the road, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles, creating a congested traffic flow. In addition to the vehicles, there are several pedestrians walking along the sidewalks, adding to the bustling atmosphere. Some of the pedestrians are closer to the camera, while others are further away. A building can also be seen in the background, adding to the urban setting.
Physical Environment Description
Scene Overview

Location: The environment is an urban city street, characterized by multiple vehicles, buildings, and pedestrians.
Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.
Objects and Distances

Vehicles:
White Car: Directly to the left of Unit 1, parked on the side of the road. Estimated distance: approximately 3-5 meters.
Black Car: Positioned farther down the road, on the same side as the white car. Estimated distance: approximately 8-10 meters.
Green Bus: Driving down the street, passing by the parked cars. Estimated distance: approximately 15-20 meters.
Pedestrians:
Left Side: Two people walking on the sidewalk, approximately 10-15 meters away.
Right Side: One person standing on the sidewalk, approximately 5-10 meters away.
Buildings:
Several buildings are visible in the background, providing context for the urban setting.
Traffic Lights and Signs:
Traffic lights are visible at the intersection ahead, about 20-30 meters away.
Street signs provide additional context for the urban environment.
LiDAR Object Detection Results

Vehicle Detection:
14.37 meters away at 338.02 degrees: Likely one of the parked cars or a moving vehicle in the upper left quadrant relative to Unit 1.
16.26 meters away at 181.69 degrees: Directly behind Unit 1.
GPS Module Information

Transmitter (Unit 2):
Distance: 9.52 meters away.
Bearing: 358.70 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly north).
Potential Obstacles
Vehicles:
Multiple parked and moving vehicles at varying distances can create potential obstacles, causing blockage or reflection of signals.
Pedestrians:
Pedestrians can cause temporary signal blockage or reflection, adding dynamic elements to the environment.
Buildings and Structures:
Buildings on either side of the street can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals, especially those in higher frequency ranges.
Environmental Factors

Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.
Summary of Scene
The physical environment includes a well-lit urban city street with multiple vehicles, pedestrians, and buildings. The parked and moving vehicles, as well as the pedestrians, serve as potential obstacles, impacting the line of sight for wireless communication between Unit 1 and Unit 2. The buildings on either side of the street can introduce additional interference and attenuation effects. Overall, the clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with vehicles and pedestrians can cause fluctuations in signal quality.
