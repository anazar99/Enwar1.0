Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The receiver (Unit 1) is 16.452267066094496 meters away at a bearing of 171.16386919015633 degrees from the transmitter (Unit 2). LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 10.09 meters away at a direction of 345.35 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 18.56 meters away at a direction of 319.09 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 10.38 meters away at a direction of 204.80 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene is captured from the front view of a car driving down a city street. There are several vehicles on the road, including cars, trucks, and buses, creating a bustling urban environment. The sun is shining brightly in the sky, casting a warm and inviting glow over the scene. In addition to the vehicles, there are several buildings visible in the background, contributing to the vibrant atmosphere of the city.The scene depicts a view from the back of a car as it drives down a city street. There are several vehicles on the road, including a white car, a blue car, and a black truck. Additionally, there are two motorcycles in the scene, one behind the white car and the other behind the black truck. A traffic light can be seen in the distance, indicating that the cars are approaching an intersection.
Physical Environment Description

Scene Overview
- Location: The environment is an urban city street, characterized by multiple vehicles, buildings, and natural elements like trees and shrubs.
- Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.

Objects and Distances
1. Vehicles:
   - First Image:
     - Vehicle 1: White car visible on the right lane, approximately 20 meters ahead.
     - Vehicle 2: Other vehicles in the middle distance, about 50-100 meters ahead.
   - Second Image:
     - Vehicle 1: White car on the left lane, approximately 5 meters away.
     - Vehicle 2: Blue car farther down the street, about 30 meters away.
     - Vehicle 3: Black car, approximately 35 meters away.

2. Pedestrians:
   - No pedestrians visible in these images.

3. Buildings:
   - Left Side: Residential and commercial buildings, with some greenery around.
   - Right Side: Primarily commercial buildings with visible greenery.

4. Trees and Greenery:
   - Trees and shrubs line the street, providing a natural touch to the urban environment.
   - Visible greenery and bushes along the sidewalks and in front of buildings.

5. Sidewalks and Street Elements:
   - First Image: Sidewalks on both sides of the street with some shrubs and small plants near the sidewalk.
   - Second Image: Clear sidewalks with visible trees and some residential structures.

LiDAR Object Detection Results
- Vehicle Detection:
  - 10.09 meters away at 345.35 degrees: Vehicle likely in the front view of Unit 1.
  - 18.56 meters away at 319.09 degrees: Vehicle detected further ahead.
  - 10.38 meters away at 204.80 degrees: Vehicle positioned slightly behind Unit 1.

GPS Module Information
- Transmitter (Unit 2):
  - Distance: 16.45 meters away.
  - Bearing: 171.16 degrees from Unit 1 (essentially directly south).

Potential Obstacles
1. Vehicles:
   - Multiple vehicles at varying distances create potential obstacles, causing blockage or reflection of signals.

2. Trees and Greenery:
   - Trees and shrubs can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals, especially those in higher frequency ranges.

3. Buildings and Structures:
   - Buildings on either side of the street can obstruct the LoS and attenuate signals.

Environmental Factors
- Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
- Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.

Summary of Scene
The physical environment includes a well-lit urban city street with multiple vehicles, buildings, and trees. The vehicles and trees serve as potential obstacles, impacting the line of sight for wireless communication between Unit 1 and Unit 2. The buildings on either side of the street can introduce additional interference and attenuation effects. The clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with vehicles can cause fluctuations in signal quality.
