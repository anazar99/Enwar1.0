Given the following information captured from unit1, describe the physical environment this information provides and be as detailed as possible. Do your best to estimate distances of objects and their types, if there are any, and if there are any blockages from obstacles, cars, pedestrians or anything that can cause obstacles. Unit1 is a vehicle with a 360 camera (two 180 degree cameras), 360 degree 3D lidar, and a GPS module, unit2 is a vehicle mounted with a GPS module and a transmitter. The transmitter (Unit 2) is 134.9016963054195 meters away from the receiver (Unit 1) where Unit 1 is at a bearing of 178.86933709163418 degrees from Unit 2. LiDAR object detection results: A Vehicle is detected 15.51 meters away at a direction of 66.55 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 22.92 meters away at a direction of 29.51 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 18.97 meters away at a direction of 80.52 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 12.68 meters away at a direction of 201.62 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 3.70 meters away at a direction of 205.08 degrees. A Vehicle is detected 26.97 meters away at a direction of 116.24 degrees. Scene details from camera: The scene depicts a car driving down a city street, as seen from the driver's point of view. The car is parked on the side of the road, and there are several other vehicles visible in the background. The sun is shining brightly in the sky, casting a warm and inviting glow over the scene. Additionally, there are trees lining the street, adding a natural touch to the urban environment.The scene depicts a view from the back of a car as it drives down a busy city street. There are multiple cars visible in the scene, with some parked on the side of the road and others passing by. In addition to the cars, there are several pedestrians walking along the sidewalks, adding to the bustling atmosphere of the city. Some of the pedestrians are closer to the camera, while others are further away. A traffic light can be seen in the distance, indicating the flow of traffic on the street.
 Physical Environment Description

 Scene Overview
- Location: The environment is an urban city street, characterized by multiple vehicles, buildings, and natural elements like trees and shrubs.
- Weather: Clear skies with bright sunlight, indicating a sunny day.

 Objects and Distances
1. Vehicles:
   - Vehicle 1: Detected 15.51 meters away at a direction of 66.55 degrees.
   - Vehicle 2: Detected 22.92 meters away at a direction of 29.51 degrees.
   - Vehicle 3: Detected 18.97 meters away at a direction of 80.52 degrees.
   - Vehicle 4: Detected 12.68 meters away at a direction of 201.62 degrees.
   - Vehicle 5: Detected 3.70 meters away at a direction of 205.08 degrees.
   - Vehicle 6: Detected 26.97 meters away at a direction of 116.24 degrees.

2. Pedestrians:
   - Second Image: No pedestrians are visible in the immediate vicinity.

3. Buildings:
   - Left Side: Several buildings, including a mix of residential and commercial structures, such as apartment complexes and storefronts.
   - Right Side: Multiple buildings, primarily residential, with some greenery around.

4. Trees and Greenery:
   - Trees and shrubs line the street, providing a natural touch to the urban environment.
   - First Image: Trees are visible on both sides of the street, adding greenery to the scene.

5. Sidewalks and Street Elements:
   - First Image: Sidewalks on both sides of the street, with some shrubs and small plants near the sidewalk.
   - Second Image: Clear sidewalks with visible trees and a fence.

 GPS Module Information
- Transmitter (Unit 2):
  - Distance: 134.90 meters away.
  - Bearing: 178.87 degrees from Unit 1.

 Potential Obstacles
1. Vehicles:
   - Multiple vehicles at varying distances can create potential obstacles, causing blockage or reflection of signals.

2. Trees and Greenery:
   - Trees can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals, especially those in higher frequency ranges (e.g., 2.4 GHz and above).

3. Buildings and Structures:
   - Buildings on either side of the street can obstruct the line of sight (LoS) and attenuate signals.

 Environmental Factors
- Clear Weather: Beneficial for wireless communication with minimal signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions.
- Sunlight: Bright sunlight can cause glare, affecting optical sensors and cameras.

 Summary of Scene
The physical environment includes a well-lit urban city street with multiple vehicles, buildings, and trees. The vehicles and trees serve as potential obstacles, impacting the line of sight for wireless communication between Unit 1 and Unit 2. The buildings on either side of the street can introduce additional interference and attenuation effects. The clear weather aids in maintaining good signal propagation conditions, though the dynamic nature of the environment with vehicles can cause fluctuations in signal quality.
